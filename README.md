# Braintools
Repository with C++ code based on ITK for brain MRI processing

Important:
This code supports version **3.20** of ITK. It has not been coded yet for newer versions and it won't compile with them. Also, the CMakelists might need some tweaking to define the ITK path depending on your OS.
